# PlayGrounds
This is to primarily showcase my expertise completly!
A public space to showcase learning curve I suppose..

Learning Path right now: 
- [ ] Relearn basic CLI commands - Linux/Bash.

    My Git Cheatsheet Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-cheat-sheet/ 
    - [ ] Will create an automatic setup to commit changes to the git but not push with the help of: 
    - PS1 script to create an automated Windows Task Scheduler [x]
        This is an automated process which occurs everyday at a specific time. 
        Improvement version should provide active trigger for only when changes in the repository are made. 
        Is this a healthy practice? 
        In short. No. I am just playing around with whatever I can find. 
    - PS1 script to automate git commands.
    Why? I suppose it is see what I can do with some reading.
